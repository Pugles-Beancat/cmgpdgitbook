Prior to impounding the vehicle you should inform the driver that their vehicle is being impounded under Section 99 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.

When impounded, give the civilian all the information they need to know to collect their vehicle from the impound lot and let them know a GPS can be found on their map, the fee is Â£10,000 - especially if they are a new player.

* Use general common sense when using the impound function.
* Do NOT impound vehicles without an owner present. (unless itâ€™s an abandoned car follow the process below). With an abandoned vehicle DV where possible, if the vehicle is locked clamp it if it's in a safe place. If it's causing an obstruction in the middle of the road you may impound the vehicle.&#x20;
