# üó∫ Communications Handbook

1.1   To ensure the safety of other officers, it is important to all operations that radio communications are up to standard. Communications are one of the most important parts of the police force. They help officers understand what is going on in situations so they can deal with them to the best of their ability.&#x20;



2.1   Communications should be kept clear and organised - this means keep comms to only relevant, precise information, ensuring that your communications are short and to the point, with as much detail as possible without reading a book!

2.1.1  Panics - If you find yourself in a situation where you need to use your panic button, you must be smart about the communications you give.&#x20;



3.1  There are important commands that can be used to help when communicating. These go as follows:&#x20;

* /showcompass
* /streetnames
* /blipson

3.1.2  Despite street names being useful sometimes, try and stick to using POI‚Äôs (points of interest) when communicating in pursuits. These are well known locations that people will be able to understand and respond to the situations quicker and easier.

3.2  Do not speak over other people when they are giving out communications. For communications to be as clear and concise as possible, they require teamwork. Speaking over one another turns the radio into a disaster. So if you hear someone is already giving comms on one situation, wait until they‚Äôre done and then proceed to give yours.&#x20;

3.3  If you are in an ongoing pursuit and you‚Äôre the one giving communications and an NPAS or RPU unit joins in, you must then let them take over communications. They should say ‚ÄúNPAS/RPU taking over communications‚Äù via whispers.&#x20;



4.1  When officers join the Police Force, they are assigned a static call sign. Officers must use this call sign to identify themselves on the radio when attending to any active situations, patrols or pursuits. E.g. ‚ÄúThis is RT-20 currently responding to the latest store robbery‚Äù.&#x20;

4.2  As soon as you get into a pursuit, the first 2 things you need to communicate is the colour of the vehicle you are chasing and a general area of where the chase is taking place. This instantly narrows it down for other officers who get themselves involved as they have got 2 specific factors to look for and it leaves you room to make finer details as the pursuit goes on.&#x20;

E.g. ‚ÄúThis is RT-20, I‚Äôm currently in pursuit of a black Audi going past the Casino towards the Bank of England area.

4.3  The next thing you want to focus on is the appearance of the suspect (if you know it). If you don‚Äôt know it, simply just say ‚Äúappearance of the suspect unknown‚Äù. However if you do know what the suspect looks like, you want to focus on the colour and type of clothes they are wearing and their skin colour (if you can see it).&#x20;

E.g. ‚ÄúThis is RT-20, I‚Äôm currently in pursuit of a black Audi going past the Casino towards the Bank of England area. The person inside the vehicle is an IC-1 Male and is wearing an all black adidas tracksuit.    &#x20;

* IC-1 - White (North European)
* IC-2 - White (South European)
* IC-3 - Black
* IC-4 - Asian
* IC-5 - Chinese, Japanese or Southeast Asian
* IC-6 - Arab or North African
* IC-9 - Unknown

4.4  Now you‚Äôve given basic communications, you can now go on to refining your location by giving names of POI‚Äôs (points of interest) as you pass them during your pursuit and the direction (North, South, East & West).&#x20;

E.g. ‚ÄúThis is RT-20, I‚Äôm currently in pursuit of a black Audi going past the Casino towards the Bank of England area. The person inside the vehicle is an IC-1 Male and is wearing an all black adidas tracksuit. We are now going to be heading Northbound continuing on past double VIP‚Äù.&#x20;



4.5  As the pursuit goes on, instead of saying ‚Äúummmm‚Äù, you can give additional communications such as the threat level (based on the weapon/firearm they are carrying), the weather conditions and the speed of the vehicle.&#x20;

E.g. ‚ÄúThis is RT-20, I‚Äôm currently in pursuit of a black Audi going past the Casino towards the Bank of England area. The person inside the vehicle is an IC-1 Male and is wearing an all black adidas tracksuit. We are now going to be heading Northbound continuing on past double VIP‚Äù. We are now continuing past double VIP, the vehicle is travelling at speeds of 160 mph+, threat level low as the suspect is carrying a knife, weather conditions wet & slippery.
