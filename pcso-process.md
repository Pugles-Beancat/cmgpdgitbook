The interview will usually take you 15 minutes depending on the PCSO. In the interview you will generate random questions that the PCSO will need to answer and you should score them appropriately. This is where good judgment comes into play, making sure you are giving the PCSO honest scores and not being biased in any way shape or form.



### <mark style="color:blue;">Basic Training</mark> <a href="#docs-internal-guid-76e5797b-7fff-f1a7-c143-091cd3e9b9f3" id="docs-internal-guid-76e5797b-7fff-f1a7-c143-091cd3e9b9f3"></a>

Basic training is where you will teach the PCSO all about the MET PD, from making sure they know how to set up whispers, to teaching them about how to properly handle a firearm. The knowledge that they learn in this training is crucial to their progression within the MET PD.

The ride along is where you will take the PCSO for their first bit of action within the city, you will have them with you at all times so that they can learn what to do. It is crucial that you teach the PCSO all of the things they need in order to progress and pass their final exam.

The final exam is a series of questions and scenarios that you as an examiner will need to execute. It is imperative that you score the PCSO honestly and make sure to look for any signs of where they could improve.
